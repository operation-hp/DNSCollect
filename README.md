<img width="763" alt="DNSCollect-intro" src="https://github.com/operation-hp/DNSCollect/assets/51909803/ed3aee93-b65b-43f1-85de-a6ccd33e00b1">

When a high risk event happens, Windows Event Log trigger a ping command with the eventID as the subdomain. The domain does not exist but the DNS query is stored in DNS log and can be used to generate alerts. 

- **Supply Chain Safety**: Supply chain attacks are increasingly frequent, DNSCollect offers an agent-less approach, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

- **Remote Collections**: DNSCollect capitalizes on DNS queries, enabling seamless remote event log collections without the need for installations or intrusive permissions.

It is still in beta and will benefit from real-world testing. If you're in the cybersecurity realm or just curious, we'd appreciate it if you could take DNSCollect for a spin. Your feedback can be invaluable in refining and enhancing this tool for the community.
